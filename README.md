# Multiverse Mars Rover

An implementation of Mars Rover Challenge using:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - New & faster JS runtime environment (faster than V8)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Testing framework

## Challenge

Write a program that takes in commands and moves one or more robots around
Mars.

**Note:** I've tweaked this challenge to support multiple planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, etc...)

- The world should be modelled as a grid with size (m x n)
- The program should read the input, update the robots, and print out the final states of the robots
- Each robot has a position (x, y), and an orientation (N, E, S, W)
- Each robot can move forward one space (F), rotate left by 90 degrees (L), or rotate right by 90 degrees (R)
- If a robot moves off the grid, it is marked as ‘lost’ and its last valid grid position and orientation is recorded
- Going from x -> x + 1 is in the easterly direction, and y -> y + 1 is in the northerly direction. i.e. (0, 0) represents the south-west corner of the grid

## Questions

- Can robots encounter obstacles? i.e. other robots?
- What happens if a robot receives a command that is not supported?
- What happens if a robot hasn't landed? (i.e. initial coordinates of robot is not valid)
- What happens if the robot is a complete **bimbo**? (i.e the orientation isn't valid)
- Do we have any limitations? i.e. program should run in O(n)? I don't think thats possible since each robot can have m number of commands? Maybe O(nm)?
- Can grid coordinates have negative values?
- Why doesn't the robot support backwards?

## Getting Started

To run the program, you need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed. See their doc.

## Run

---

```sh

└─▪ cd multiverse-mars-rover

┌─[ multiverse-mars-rover ] on  master via ⬢ v19.1.0
└─▪ bun start # Runs the program

```

## Test
